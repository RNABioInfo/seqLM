# seq_lm

Live or one-shot analysis of aligned Oxford Nanopore transcriptome BAMs, with an
interactive HTML report. Includes read QC, Oarfish quantification, transcript
biotypes, edgeR differential expression, fry/GSVA gene-set analysis, and optional
iModulon projection and MinKNOW stop control.

## Quickstart

Requires **Nextflow ≥26.04.3**, **Java 17**, and **Docker** or
**Singularity/Apptainer**. Nextflow fetches published images from Docker Hub.
Windows users must run inside **WSL2** with Docker Desktop's WSL integration;
EPI2ME Desktop on Windows is not supported.

### 1. Install

Install Docker separately, then use the supplied Conda environment for Nextflow,
Java, and host utilities:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RNABioInfo/seq_lm.git
cd seq_lm
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate seq-lm
nextflow -version
```

### 2. Prepare samples

Save `samples.csv` with paths to your aligned BAM directories:

```csv
alias,group,bam_dir,is_live
control_1,control,/data/bams/control_1,true
control_2,control,/data/bams/control_2,true
treated_1,treated,/data/bams/treated_1,true
treated_2,treated,/data/bams/treated_2,true
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alias` | Yes | Sample name; unique within its group. |
| `group` | Yes | Condition; use `control` for at least two samples. Other groups are compared with controls. |
| `bam_dir` | Yes | Existing directory searched recursively for BAMs; accessible to the container. |
| `is_live` | No | Watch this sample when `live_analysis` is also true. Blank or omitted means true. |
| `order` | No | Signed integer elapsed minutes for temporal analysis. |

Headers are case-sensitive. BAMs must match the reference genome, and read IDs
must be unique across chunks of each sample. One-shot samples need at least one
BAM at startup; live directories may start empty.

For temporal analysis, add `order` to every row: each group must have one time,
each time one group, and at least two times are required. Samples represent
independent replicates. This enables ICA time-course views automatically;
gene-set time-course views additionally require `timeline_analysis = true`.

### 3. Configure and run

Save `run.config`, replacing the paths. This example runs QC, quantification,
biotypes, and differential expression once on the available BAMs:

```groovy
params {
    sample_sheet = "/path/to/samples.csv"
    reference_genome = "/path/to/reference.fa"
    reference_annotation = "/path/to/annotation.gtf"
    out_dir = "/path/to/results"
    live_analysis = false
    differential_expression = true
    gene_set_enrichment = false
    timeline_analysis = false
    ica_analysis = false
}
```

```bash
nextflow run . -profile standard -c run.config -w /path/to/work
```

Use `-profile singularity` for Singularity/Apptainer. Set parameters in the config:
quote strings, but leave booleans and numbers unquoted. Explicit boolean/numeric
CLI values reach this workflow as strings and fail schema validation.

For NCBI prokaryotic GTFs missing transcript/exon records, convert the annotation
before running:

```bash
bin/oarfish-gtf-convert genomic.gtf genomic.oarfish.gtf
```

Use the converted file as `reference_annotation`; see the
[annotation guide](docs/quantification.md#prokaryotic-annotations).

### 4. View results or run live

Open `qc_report.html` in your results directory. For live analysis, set
`live_analysis = true` in `run.config` before launching. The report updates as
stable BAM chunks arrive.

When a live sample is finished, create a `STOP` file in its BAM directory (automatically in "terminate" monitoring behavior):

```bash
touch /data/bams/treated_1/STOP
```

Repeat for every live sample. The workflow drains pending data and saves the
final report as a self-contained HTML file.

## Analysis modes

Edit the switches below in `run.config`. All modes include QC. Supply the FASTA
and GTF/GFF3 together; remove both reference settings for QC-only analysis.

| Mode | Additional inputs | `differential_expression` | `gene_set_enrichment` | `ica_analysis` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| QC only | None | false | false | false |
| Quantification and biotypes | Both references | false | false | false |
| Differential expression | Both references | true | false | false |
| Gene-set analysis | Both references, `gene_sets` GMT | true | true | false |
| iModulon analysis | Both references, `ica_matrix` CSV/TSV | false | false | true |
| Combined analysis | Both references, GMT, ICA matrix | true | true | true |

Keep `timeline_analysis = false` unless gene-set enrichment is enabled and the
sample sheet contains complete time metadata.

For iModulons, use a compatible gene-by-component weight matrix. Add
`ica_imodulon_table = "/path/to/iM_table.csv"` for names and functions from the
**same model**, with one annotation row per component. The report shows
**Time course details** when time metadata is present, otherwise **Component details**.
Diagnostics contains the component annotations. See the
[iModulon guide](docs/imodulon_analysis.md) for model formats and interpretation.

## Outputs and restarting

| Path under `out_dir` | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `qc_report.html` | Main report; live updates during sequencing, self-contained on completion. |
| `qc_report_state.json`, `qc_report_snapshot_revision_*.html` | Live-report state and immutable snapshots. |
| `<group>/<alias>/` | Sample QC, quantification, and `FINAL` completion marker. |
| `differential_expression/` | Differential-expression and gene-set results. |
| `ica/` | iModulon snapshots; `latest.json` identifies the newest snapshot and readiness. |
| `stability/` | Stability decisions and stop-control records. |
| `execution/` | Nextflow report, timeline, and trace. |

Reuse `out_dir` to restore finalized samples and extend an experiment. Changed
inputs or references prevent checkpoint reuse. This is separate from Nextflow
`-resume`; use a new output directory for a fresh analysis. Pin a workflow
revision with `-r` when launching `RNABioInfo/seq_lm` directly.

## EPI2ME Desktop (Linux/macOS)

Fully quit EPI2ME, activate `seq-lm`, and point it to the installed Nextflow:

```bash
# Linux
LABS_NXF_PATH="$(command -v nextflow)" /usr/lib/epi2me/EPI2ME

# macOS
LABS_NXF_PATH="$(command -v nextflow)" /Applications/EPI2ME.app/Contents/MacOS/EPI2ME
```

Keep the terminal open. In **Workflows → Import workflow**, enter
`https://github.com/rnabioinfo/seq_lm`, then select **Run this workflow** and fill
in the inputs. Repeat the launch command after restarting EPI2ME.

## Stability monitoring and MinKNOW termination

Set `monitoring_behavior = "log"` to record stop eligibility, or `"terminate"`
to stop eligible acquisitions. Monitoring requires differential expression;
termination also requires live analysis and MinKNOW credentials.

Generate credentials in the activated `seq-lm` environment:

```bash
bin/seq-run-manager cert \
    --minknow-client-certs-directory /path/to/minknow/conf/rpc-client-certs
```

Add these settings inside the existing `params` block in `run.config`:

```groovy
live_analysis = true
monitoring_behavior = "terminate"
minknow_client_certificate = "/path/to/minknow_cert.pem"
minknow_client_private_key = "/path/to/minknow_key.pem"
minknow_ca_certificate = "/path/to/minknow_cert.crt"
```

Each BAM directory's parent must contain one matching MinKNOW `*sample_sheet*.csv`.
The workflow creates `STOP` only after MinKNOW confirms termination. See the
[monitoring guide](docs/differential_expression.md#differential-expression-stability)
for sample matching, stability criteria, and connection setup.
